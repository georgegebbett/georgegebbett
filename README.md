### Hello, I'm George 👋

I'm an aspiring software developer, currently studying a Law degree at the University of Southampton, due to graduate in summer 2022. 

My GitHub is a bit of a mess - I don't really have any long-term projects, instead choosing to build little things as and when I need them.

I'm looking to ramp up my OSS contributions - if you have a repo that needs Python/JS/basic Java contributions then hit me up!
